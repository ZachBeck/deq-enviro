### Hello {{Config.Description}} Administrator,\n\nWe need you to perform some administrative actions on a person that has just requested access to a site that you manage.\n\n**{{User.FullName}}**, _({{User.Email}})_, from **{{User.Agency}}** has requested access to the **{{Config.Description}}**.\n\nWe need you to make sure that {{User.First}} should be allowed to access this website _and_ data. You will be able to **accept** {{User.First}} into their appropriate role and restrict {{User.First}}'s access to protected data or **reject** {{User.First}}'s request from the [user administration page]({{Config.BaseUrl}}{{Config.adminUrl}}).\n\nThank you and enjoy the rest of your day!\n\n_An email will be sent to all of the other administrators after you perform one of these actions._
